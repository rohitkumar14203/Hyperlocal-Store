# Hyperlocal Store

This is a part of a hyperlocal store application where users can explore nearby stores and view the products available at each location. The application fetches store data from a backend API and displays the stores in a grid layout, allowing users to click and view products from any of the stores.

## Features

- **View Stores**: Displays a list of stores with their names and locations.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts based on screen size, ensuring a seamless experience on both mobile and desktop.
- **Clean UI**: Simple, modern design with clear typography and card-based layout for each store.
